# sinkingTheShips
A plain vanilla JS based game, user need to enter the cell number and see if he/she hit the ship or not
this game is developed using book "Head First JavaScript by Eric Freeman", However I have added functionality beyond the book and augmenting further. Viz. refactored the code to be capable of handling both lower case and upper case user input!
